# Chicago Stenographer Keycaps - MX Stem

This is a fork of [infused-kim/kb_keycaps_chicago_stenographer](https://github.com/infused-kim/kb_keycaps_chicago_stenographer) which is a downstream fork of [pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles](https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles).

You can find an incomplete set of STLs of Chicago Steno with MX stem, in original Choc (18x17mm) spacing, in [the stl folder](./stl/). They have cuts on the sides for FDM printing and slightly increased height compared to original version.

If you'd like to have these MJF printed, you can find sprued version at [ykz89/cs-choc-spc-mx-stem](https://github.com/ykz89/cs-choc-spc-mx-stem). These are also available as resin cast keycaps at [Asymplex](https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/made-to-order-mx-stem-cs-kits).
